These precautions will serve as the basis for evaluating forklift operation in the video.  2. Video Analysis and Procedure Adherence Check: Analyze the video clip to identify instances where the forklift operation deviates from the extracted safety precautions. Specifically, focus on:  Speed: Determine the forklift's speed. If it exceeds 2.3 m/s, flag it as a deviation. Other Precautions: Identify any other violations of the extracted safety precautions (e.g., improper loading, failure to follow stopping procedures). Record the timestamps of all deviations.  3. Incident Report Generation: Generate a JSON report for each identified deviation from the safe forklift operation procedures. The JSON structure for each incident includes:  \"ID\" : A sequentially numbered ID starting from 0050. The sequence continues from the highest ID in the previous task's results. \"Short description\" : A concise description of the incident (e.g., \"Excessive forklift speed\", \"Improper forklift stopping procedure\"). \"Description\" : A detailed description of the deviation, including the timestamp(s) from the video and a reference to the violated safety precaution from the procedure document. \"Category\" : \"incident\" \"Video filename\" : The name of the input video file. \"Procedure document filename\" : The name of the input procedure document file. \"Violated precaution\" (optional): A more detailed description of the violated precaution from the procedure document."
